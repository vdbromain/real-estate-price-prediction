# Regression

- Repository: `real-estate-price-prediction`
- Type of Challenge: `Consolidation`
- Duration: `6 days`
- Deadline: `26/01/2022 04:30 PM` **(code)**
- Team challenge : Solo

## Learning objectives

- Be able to preprocess data for Machine Learning
- Be able to apply a Machine Learning model in a real context.
- Be able to evaluate a Machine Learning model with the appropriate metrics

## The Mission

After your brilliant presentation about the Belgian Real Estate market, the company "ImmoEliza" asks you to create a Machine Learning model to predict prices on Belgium's real estate sales.

Take the dataset that was previously **scraped**, **preprocessed** and **analyzed**.

Preprocess the data to be used with machine learning:

- You have to handle NANs
- You have to handle categorical data
- You have to normalize continuous data
- You have to remove features that have too strong correlation
- You have to select relevant features for your model

Then you will need to select a model, train, test and evaluate it on your dataset.

### Must-have features

!! Before starting the project itself, discover the machine learning topics by having a round [here](../../4.machine_learning/)

#### Step 1 : Data cleaning

You have collected your data, you have cleaned and analyzed it a first time!
So it's time to do some machine learning with it!

But first, we have to prepare the data for machine learning.

- No duplicates
- No NANs
- No text data
- No features that have too strong correlation between them
- Use data normalization / scaling

#### Step 2: Data formatting

Now that the dataset is ready, you have to format it for machine learning:

- Divide your dataset for training and testing. (`X_train`, `y_train`, `X_test`, `y_test`)

#### Step 3: Model selection

The dataset is ready. Now let's select a model.

Look at which models make the most sense according to your data.

#### Step 4: Model Training

Train your model on your data.

#### Step 5: Model evaluation

Let's evaluate your model by selecting the most appropriate metrics. Which performance did you reach?
Try to answer those questions:

- How could you improve this result?
- Which part of the process has the most impact on the results?
- How should you divide your time working on this kind of project?

## Constraints

### Code style

- Each **function or class** has to be **typed**
- Each **function or class** has to contain a **docstring**
- Your code should be **formatted** with [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/).
- Your code should be **commented** when necessary.
- Your code should be **cleaned of any commented unused code**.

## Deliverables

1. Merge your branch with your `main branch` and make sure your repo is clean
2. Pimp up the README file:
   - Description
   - Installation
   - Usage
   - (Visuals)
   - (Contributors)
   - (Timeline)
   - (Personal situation)

### Steps

1. Create a new branch in your repository
2. Add a folder `model_training`
3. Study the request (What & Why ?)
4. Identify technical challenges (How ?)
